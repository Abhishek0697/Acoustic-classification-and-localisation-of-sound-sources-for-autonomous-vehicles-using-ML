Audio-based perception for autonomous cars is very important for discerning and comprehending the environment, as it can complement existing vision-based perception and pave the way for multimodal operation. However, these sensors have not yet been fully established in modern autonomous vehicles, robbing the system of context when needing to make important driving decisions.  Our project seeks to take steps towards tackling this by applying machine learning techniques to help separate, classify and localise sounds of objects in a carâ€™s vicinity. With these two capabilities, a car is more well-informed of its surroundings and can act accordingly (such as responding and making way for police cars, ambulances and fire trucks).
